                            Kailashtilla gas field is one of the largest gas fields in Bangladesh with six wells. It has been producing gas since 1983. Most of the reserve estimations are based on geological data and production data only used for flowing material balance. But in this study, production data is used for decline curve analyses which also include decline type curves that are useful for reserve estimation at any time of reservoir life. Methods that used for this analysis are: Traditional decline curve, Blasingame, Normalized pressure integral, Transient analysis, and flowing material balance for reserve estimation and skin, permeability calculation. A single method is not possible to apply perfectly for each of well which are grouped in total four gas sand (upper, middle, lower & HRZ). Lower gas sand is abandoned after long time production which is not included for final EUR calculation.

                            This study estimates mainly gas initially in place (GIIP), recoverable reserves, and recovery factor of Kilashtilla gas field. The result of calculation shows that GIIP is about 3.1 Tcf, recoverable reserves is about 2.03 Tcf and recovery factor is 74%. Also this analysis suffers from liquid loading problem and may presence of aquifer or partially fault.

                            Kailashtilla gas field is one of the largest gas fields in Bangladesh consists of six wells. It has been producing gas since 1983. Most of the reserve estimations for this field were based on geological data and production data were used only for flowing material balance. In this study, production data is used for decline curve analyses which also include decline type curves that are useful for reserve estimation at any time of the reservoir life. Methods that are used for this analysis are: Traditional decline curve, Blasingame type curves, Normalized pressure integral, transient analysis, and flowing material balance for reserve estimation and early time parameters like skin and permeability calculation. A single method is not suitable to be applied perfectly for each of the wells which are grouped in total four gas sands (upper, middle, lower & HRZ). Lower gas sand is abandoned after long time production which is not included for final EUR calculation. This study estimates mainly gas initially in place (GIIP), Expected ultimate recovery and recovery factor systematically of Kilashtilla gas field. From this study it is found that GIIP is about 3.1 Tcf, recoverable reserves is about 2.03 Tcf and recovery factor is around 74%. Also this analysis reveals liquid loading problem and presence of aquifer in this field.
